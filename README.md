NOTE: This research work is conducted with a private dataset from Company X.
Due to data privacy and confidentiality agreements, the actual data is not shared.
Please replace 'your_dataset' with your own data to run the script.

The original dataset contains the typical semiconductor wafer defects. The defects are similar to the types of defects 
found in the publically available Semiconductor wafer dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qingyi/wm811k-wafer-map
